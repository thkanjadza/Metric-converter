Metric Unit converter
Objectives: 
 • Use the tkinter module to enter text, evaluate expressions and use buttons to invoke functions. 
Topics:
Label and Button widgets. 
Functions Configure settings .place() 
Assignment: 
1. Create a program that uses tkinter that allows a user to convert a value in millilitres to teaspoons, tablespoons and ounces. 
• The root window must include settings for a title.
• Create three functions where each function will convert millilitres to teaspoons, tablespoons and ounces:
• teaspoons: millilitres * 0.2029
• tablespoons: millilitres * 0.0676
• ounces: millilitres * 0.0338
• Within each function, create an object with a .config method where a text option is assigned the result, converted to a string. Each of the objects will be assigned to the same identifier that will store the result and the settings.
• Create a label with instructions to the user.
• Create an Entry box for the user’s input.
• Create a label with instructions to choose a volume type.
• Create three buttons, one for each volume type:
• Each button will have appropriate text describing what it is for and a command option to call the appropriate function.
• Create a label that shows the result. Assign it to the same identifier used in the functions.
• Use the .place() method to position all labels, buttons and entry.
